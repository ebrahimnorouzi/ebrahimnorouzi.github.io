Welcome! I am a Junior Researcher at [FIZ Karlsruhe](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Dr. Harald Sack](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/forschung/lebenslauf-prof-dr-harald-sack){:target="_blank"}. I hold an MSc degree in [Materials Science and Simulation (ICAMS)](https://www.icams.de/){:target="_blank"} from Ruhr University of Bochum. After completing my masterâ€™s degree, I worked as a scientific researcher at the Materials Informatics group of Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials, [IWM](https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/en.html){:target="_blank"}. I have a solid knowledge of the programming language Python and various data science techniques such as machine learning, statistical analysis and data visualization as well as front-end development, and database management. I acquired a deep understanding of material characterization techniques from my previous work at [the Max Planck Institute for Iron research](https://www.mpie.de/2281/en){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include Machine Learning, Semantic Web, and Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science.
