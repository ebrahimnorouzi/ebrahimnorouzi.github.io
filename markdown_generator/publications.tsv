2024-08-12	The landscape of ontologies in materials science and engineering: A survey and evaluation	"SeMatS 2024 (International Workshop on Semantic Materials Science
Harnessing the Power of Semantic Web Technologies in Materials Science
at SEMANTICS 2024)"	"This paper provides an overview of ontologies used in Materials Science and Engineering to assist domain experts in selecting the most suitable ontology for a given purpose. Sixty selected ontologies are analyzed and compared based on the requirements outlined in this paper. Statistical data on ontology reuse and key metrics are also presented. The evaluation results provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the investigated MSE ontologies. This enables domain experts to select suitable ontologies and to incorporate relevant terms from existing resources. "	E. Norouzi, J.Waitelonis, H. Sack.

2024-04-29	OAEI Machine Learning Dataset for Online Model Generation	ESWC 2024 Poster	"Ontology and knowledge graph matching systems are evaluated annually by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). More and more systems use machine learning-based approaches, including large language models. The training and validation datasets are usually determined by the system developer and often a subset of the reference alignments are used. This sampling is against the OAEI rules and makes a fair comparison impossible. Furthermore, those models are trained offline (a trained and optimized model is packaged into the matcher) and therefore the systems are specifically trained for those tasks. In this paper, we introduce a dataset that contains training, validation, and test sets for most of the OAEI tracks. Thus, online model learning (the systems must adapt to the given input alignment without human intervention) is made possible to enable a fair comparison for ML-based systems. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset by fine-tuning the confidence thresholds of popular systems. "	Hertling, S., Norouzi, E., & Sack, H. (2024).

2024-07-09	KGMistral: Towards Boosting the Performance of Large Language Models for Question Answering with Knowledge Graph Integration	In Workshop on Deep Learning and Large Language Models for Knowledge Graphs.	In this paper, a novel question-answering (QA) approach named KGMistral is proposed, based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Given the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate answers for domains not adequately covered by their training corpus, this work focuses on leveraging external domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance the performance of LLMs. Specifically, the study examines the benefits of using information from a KG to improve the QA performance of the Mistral model in the material science and engineering field. Experimental results indicate that KGMistral significantly enhances Mistral‚Äôs QA performance.	Li, M., Yang, H., Liu, Z., Alam, M. M., Sack, H., & Gesese, G. A. (2024).

2023-03-21	Enhancing Entity Alignment Between Wikidata and ArtGraph Using LLMs	International Joint Workshop on Semantic Web and Ontology Design for Cultural Heritage	This paper focuses on the Wikidata and A ùëüùë° G ùëüùëéùëù‚Ñé KGs, which exhibit gaps in content that can be filled by enriching one with data from the other. Entity alignment can help to combine data from KGs by connecting entities that refer to the same real-world entities. However, entity alignment in art-domain knowledge graphs remains under-explored. In the pursuit of entity alignment between A ùëüùë° G ùëüùëéùëù‚Ñé and Wikidata, a hybrid approach is proposed.

2023-09-07	Knowledge Graph Based RDM Solutions: NFDI4Culture-NFDI-MatWerk-NFDI4DataScience	"1st Conference on Research Data Infrastructure (CoRDI) - Connecting Communities "	Based on our experience within the NFDI4Culture and NFDI-MatWerk projects we propose generalized knowledge graph based research data management solutions, which are applicable to other consortia. Our solution covers the construction of a common NFDI core ontology adapted to specific domains via domain extensions as a basis for a knowledge graph (KG) providing information about a consortium and its related research data and software resources. This KG serves as a backend for the web portal that enables interactive access and management of this data. Already implemented for NFDI4Culture and to be adapted by NFDI-MatWerk, this solution might serve as an example solution also for other consortia. We are synchronizing our efforts with ongoing work to implement knowledge graph based research data management in NFDI4DataScience.

Specifically, we apply and analyze this identification approach using short-term uniaxial relaxation tests on a C19010 copper alloy.	Morand, L., Norouzi, E., Weber, M. et al.

Various geometrical designs of the starter block and spiral grain selector are chosen and their effects on crystal orientation of the single-crystal part are studied. The competitive grain selection is simulated utilizing the cellular automaton finite element module of the ProCAST software.	F. Sadeghi, A. Kermanpur, E.
