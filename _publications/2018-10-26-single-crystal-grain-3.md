collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-10-26-single-crystal-grain-3
excerpt: 'An attempt is made to model the design of grain selection during single-crystal solidification of an Ni-based superalloy by the Bridgman method. Various geometrical designs of the starter block and spiral grain selector are chosen and their effects on crystal orientation of the single-crystal part are studied. The competitive grain selection is simulated utilizing the cellular automaton finite element module of the ProCAST software.'
