title: "The landscape of ontologies in materials science and engineering: A survey and evaluation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-08-12-OE-MSE-SeMats-7
excerpt: 'This paper provides an overview of ontologies used in Materials Science and Engineering to assist domain experts in selecting the most suitable ontology for a given purpose. Sixty selected ontologies are analyzed and compared based on the requirements outlined in this paper. Statistical data on ontology reuse and key metrics are also presented. The evaluation results provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the investigated MSE ontologies. This enables domain experts to select suitable ontologies and to incorporate relevant terms from existing resources. '
