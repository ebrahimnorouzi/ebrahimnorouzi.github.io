excerpt: 'The objective of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using machine learning to identify the parameters of a Chaboche-type material model that describes copper alloys. Specifically, we apply and analyze this identification approach using short-term uniaxial relaxation tests on a C19010 copper alloy.'
