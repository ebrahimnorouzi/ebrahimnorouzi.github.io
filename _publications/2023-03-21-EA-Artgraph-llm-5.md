excerpt: 'This paper focuses on the Wikidata and A 𝑟𝑡 G 𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ KGs, which exhibit gaps in content that can be filled by enriching one with data from the other. Entity alignment can help to combine data from KGs by connecting entities that refer to the same real-world entities. However, entity alignment in art-domain knowledge graphs remains under-explored. In the pursuit of entity alignment between A 𝑟𝑡 G 𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ and Wikidata, a hybrid approach is proposed.'
