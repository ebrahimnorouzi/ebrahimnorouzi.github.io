title: "Knowledge Graph Based RDM Solutions: NFDI4Culture-NFDI-MatWerk-NFDI4DataScience"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-09-07-KG-base-RDM-cordi-4
excerpt: 'Based on our experience within the NFDI4Culture and NFDI-MatWerk projects we propose generalized knowledge graph based research data management solutions, which are applicable to other consortia. Our solution covers the construction of a common NFDI core ontology adapted to specific domains via domain extensions as a basis for a knowledge graph (KG) providing information about a consortium and its related research data and software resources. This KG serves as a backend for the web portal that enables interactive access and management of this data. Already implemented for NFDI4Culture and to be adapted by NFDI-MatWerk, this solution might serve as an example solution also for other consortia. We are synchronizing our efforts with ongoing work to implement knowledge graph based research data management in NFDI4DataScience.'
